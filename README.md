 ### Overview
 
 This module is an implementation of a Q-Learning agent to solve a game where we need to collect yellow bananas while avoiding blue bananas.

 A reward of +1 is given for collecting a yellow banana, and a reward of -1 is given for collecting a blue bananna. 
 
The state space has 37 dimensions and contains the agent's velocity, along with ray-based perception of objects around the agent's forward direction. Given this information, the agent has to learn how to best select actions. Four discrete actions are available, corresponding to:

    0 - move forward.
    1 - move backward.
    2 - turn left.
    3 - turn right.
    
The task is episodic, and in order to solve the environment, your agent must get an average score of +13 over 100 consecutive episodes.
